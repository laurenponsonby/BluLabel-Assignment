# BluLabel-Assignment
QUESTION FROM BLU LABEL:      Data Analytics Skills: This gives one a chance to show us how they approach an analytics problem, whether they have the base capability we need as a data scientist, and what insight they can draw from the data that would be useful to someone in business. A generated data set which has had some common problems introduced into it is provided. One will need to load up the data set, then clean it up so it can be assessed and insight drawn from it. Plot the data, illustrate what is there and explain what can be taken away. We arenâ€™t looking for a thesis, just a clear illustration of what the candidate did, why they did it and what they found.
